##### Because NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS!


***
## A solution to [Blockstream Green Wallet](https://blockstream.com/green/)

sorry guys UX/IU not cool for no-coiners

- Fork bluewallet adn include liquid/elements fancy stuff

- set up the backend https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs 

- [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39) + 2nd master key for [CT](https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions)  

- Liquid addresses derivation [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), [BIP49](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0049.mediawiki), [BIP84](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0084.mediawiki) 

- try subvert the CT as mandatory is ugly af

- better custom assets management at presentation level 




## Payment processor 

- [BTCPay](https://btcpayserver.org/)???
